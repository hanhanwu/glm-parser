    A dictitionary-like object. Used to facilitate class FeatureSet to
    store the features.

    Callables inside the class:

    dump()  - Dump the content of the data object into memory. When we are using
              memory dict it will call Pickle to do that. When we are using

    load()  - Load the content of a disk file into the memory. When we are using
              memory dict it will call Pickle to do the load. And when we are
              using shelves it has no effect, since shelves itself is persistent
              object.

    keys()  - Return a list of keys in the dictionary.

    has_key() - Check whether a given key is in the dictionary.

    Please notice that there is no open() method as in other similar classes.
    Users must provide a file name as well as an operating mode to support
    both persistent and non-persistent (or semi-persistent) operations.
